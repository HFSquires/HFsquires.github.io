Research Experience
======
**MPhys Project** *(September 2025 – May 2026)*  
*Final Year Student*  
- **Project:** “Evaporation of Breath Figures”, supervised by Dr. David Fairhurst and Dr. Joey Kilbride.  
- Extended a [recently published study](https://doi.org/10.1103/6vms-ljj5) by investigating the dynamics of the macroscopic edge and its relation to the droplet size distribution.  
- Designed and built an experimental set-up for imaging configurations.  
- Developed image analysis workflows using ImageJ and Python.  
- Produced efficient scripts for data and statistical analysis.

**QinetiQ / The University of Edinburgh** *(June 2025 – August 2025)*  
*Summer Research Intern*  
- **Project:** “Terahertz Methods for the Characterisation of Materials”. Conducted a literature-based review aimed at advising the company’s future research direction.  
- Summarised findings in an internal report and developed a comparative table of practical trade-offs.  
- Funded by the University of Edinburgh through the Career Development Scholarship; project hosted by QinetiQ.

**The University of Melbourne (Carbon Cybernetics)** *(July 2024 – June 2025)*  
*Research Intern*  
- **Project:** “On the characterisation of carbon fibre electrodes for neural recording”, supervised by Prof. Steven Prawer.  
- *Modelling of Intracortical Microwire Electrodes for Brain–Machine Interfaces.* Manuscript in preparation. Contributing author.  
- Designed and built a bench-top testing system to optimise carbon fibre Micro Electrode Array (MEA) performance.  
- Undertook a meta-analysis of *in vivo* datasets to inform optimal MEA design.  
- Automated data acquisition and analysis workflows using MATLAB and Python.  
- Delivered weekly research presentations to the group, incorporating feedback to guide further development.
